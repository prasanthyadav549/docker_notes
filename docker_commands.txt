# docker build -t <image_name>:<tag_name>
# docker rmi <image_name>  to delete the image
# docker rm <container_id> to remove the container
# docker system prune -a  to remove the cache
# docker run -it --init --publish 3001:3000 <image_name>
    here --publish flag is used to make 3001 of the host port to interact with the 
    3000 of the container port.
    --init flag is used like we can exit in the local emv that will replicated in the container also.
# docker exec -it <image_name> bash
# docker run -it --init -v "${PWD}:/usr/src/app" node-app this command bind mounts the 
  the local app changes in the container directory here PWD will give the current working directory
  and /usr/src/app is the directory of the container.
# Learn about Docker volume
# communication between two docker containers.
  network bridge
# docker compose
# docker image prune --> remove all dangling images.
#docker run --detach -it container --> if we want to run a container in background in interactive mode.
